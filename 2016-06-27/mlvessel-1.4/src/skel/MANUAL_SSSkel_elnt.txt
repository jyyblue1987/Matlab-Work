1) What the program does:

   Thuis program receives an image I of 4-connected labels (each label
representing an object of a binary image) e an integer Nm (number of
exact dilations to be applied) and returns 3 matricses:

  - matrix C with the contours of all objects and holes in I.

  - matrix D with Nm exact dilations of all the contours in C.  (exact
dilation usinng dependent labels).

  - matrix E (skeleton) that keeps the difference image of D (the
difference image is calculated using shocks for each contour
individually).

2) Example of program use:

  Let BIN be a binary image;

  >> [label,n] = bwlabel (BIN,4); % labelling using 4-connectivity.
  >> [C,D,E] = skel (label, 30);  % SSSkel with Nm 30.

3) Compiling:

  >> mex skel.c

4) IMPORTANT:

 * ADDING TWO FRAMES: The objects of the binary image BIN should not
touch the image border (this causes an error in contour detection). If
this happens, two frames should be added to BIN.
